FOLDER CONTAINING USED DATASETS

Although all datasets are available online I prepared this folder with the csv files for each one.
They all have the same format: class is in the first column and all attributes follow. All data are numbers,
and if the original file contained strings they were encoded as labels.
Each sub-folder contains a dataset, as mentioned, and its description.

Here is where I obtained the datasets:
